    <div id="history">
      <p id="text1">Throughout highschool I was always thinking about what career to venture down. I was inclined towards the sciences but none of the traditional sciences ignited my passion. Biology and Math did not have exciting practical applications in my young mind. I decided to wait for post secondary education once I had a better perspective of the real world. I moved out of my parents' home and began working in restaurants as a chef, living on my own at 19. The experiences gained were invaluable, hard physical work combined with the reality of what a dollar meant. Cooking taught me I enjoyed being challenged, to work hard and improve myself every day I went in to work.</p>

      <p id="text2">After two years of physical labour, it was time to challenge myself mentally. I still did not have a clear idea of what I wanted to do for a career but I needed a change to spark an idea of what I would enjoy doing. I enrolled in college to take a business degree in accounting. It was the logical/analytical pillar of the business world and seemed like something I could do.</p>

      <p id="text3">I completed two years of courses in accounting when I took introduction to programming as an elective. I had no coding experience before and immediately fell in love. It was a science I was never exposed to and exactly what I was looking for my whole life. Technology was always a passion of mine, how it shaped and changed the world year by year. Being young when the internet and cell phones became main stream I feel I was born at a junction of history that was a monumental shift. I had no connection or way to be a part of it, but writing my first hello world program opened that door forever.</p>

      <p id="text4">I switched majors to Computer Science and have enjoyed every second of it, a year into courses I had family cirumstances that made me move back home with them to help out. Instead of continuing my studies I began self learning and eventually enrolled in a Web Development certification program with Lighthouse Labs. Since graduating I have been honing my skills and knowledge of web devlopment and take pride in looking back on difficult problems in Computer Science I once found impossible now being completely managable, even easy.</p>

      <p>Hello world, that was my first experience with computer programming and I was hooked ever since. As I mentioned in the previous section I switched from Accounting to Computer Science mid way through College. In intro to programming I learned the basics of data types, strings, array manipulation, functions, and objects. From there I learned HTML/CSS and enrolled in Lighthouse Labs where the more advanced optional pre curriculum projects taught me Jquery. I then began my experience with the Model View Controller system learning about SQL/MongoDb/PostGres, and how the HTTP request/response design of servers was used to create modern web applications</p>

      <p>Throughout Lighthouse I sharpened my problem solving skills, and added additional knowledge with front end UI libraries such as Bootstrap, and Semantic UI. We eventually covered React and Ruby on Rails, Graduating Lighthouse I created 8 fully functioning web applications built. After Lighthouse I made my own project using an Express Server and Jquery and continued to work on coding challenges through websites that offered them. Often these challenges had use cases involving tens of thousands of points of data, ensuring your solutions followed the best run time and big O notation practices in mind.</p>

      <p>Earlier in 2020 I decided my career and job search would be more successful if I made my own website. I launched this website to host and enable all my projects for prospective employers to demo, rather than just reading some Git repositories. Shortly after that I started volunteering with <a href='https://www.assistlist.ca' target='_blank'>assistlist.ca </a>. I worked on and launched several features for them in a React and Ruby on Rails environment, using Semantic UI. This experience has been invaluable and allowed me to further master important skills like using Git in a team with multiple test environments, merging, pushing, pulling, and sometimes reverting commits became second nature and much simpler than working on projects alone.</p>

      <p>I have learned about several intermediate web development tools like Google Analytics, local storage for cookies, and being very comfortable using window. and document. to shoestring particularly tricky problems. I then began to work for AssistList as a Canada summer jobs employee interacting with the design team frequently. Â Several projects have been built and launched by us further improving the skills and knowledge I have accumulated the past two years including responsive design and DRY coding practices</p>

      <p>I am comfortable and excited to assimilate with any development framework whatever tools the team uses. I love programming because you always learn or refine a new skill every day at work. I believe my knowledge of web development will allow me to prosper in any role where fair mentorship and training is provided, I am looking forward to learning more wherever I am given the chance.</p>

      <p>Above all I am a logical person who loves being challenged. Whether it is liking board games that are competitive with a low variance of luck and a high skill ceiling, or enjoying sports and the analytical side of it. I am competitive by nature and coding has always enticed me when presented a difficult problem and working hard to figure it out. The greatest satisfaction I have had in life comes from solving a coding problem. A big part of selecting a career was always being challenged to improve everyday and never feeling stagnation.</p>

      <p>I am a very good listener and believe it is a virtue that is often forgotten these days. No matter who you are interacting with they will often know something you don't, if you listen you will most definately learn something you had no idea you could. I am easy to get along with because I have a decent aptitude towards understanding everyone is different, and many things shape their behaviour. If you're driving along and someone does something unsafe or rude, they could just be having a very bad day, and they're a decent person. I am not quick to judge and think these two things go hand in hand when respecting and valuing other people.</p>

      <p>I have learned to think outside the box when it comes to approaching a problem, often when you are stuck and trying different solutions that are more familiar or traditional ways you would solve a problem you're missing a key piece that you are not thinking of. It is difficult to convey this without some degree of vagueness, but I find often in coding you have a pre established pattern of problem solving using concepts or tools you're familiar with. It is important to take a step back and observe if there could be a better way.  This goes hand in hand with what I mentioned in the previous section, often any problem you encounter someone else has encountered it before and a little bit of research will offer a solution you did not even consider.</p>
